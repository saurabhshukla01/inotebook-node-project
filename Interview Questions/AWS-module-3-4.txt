How to Copy EC2 from one region to another using AMI    >>>>

First I create one EC2 instance for another region create duplicate to next region .
check instance Name after change the region diff AWS account EC2 Instance 
Check Instance  >>>  Actions  >>>  Image and templates  >>> create image   ( AMI amazon machine image )
fill the details  >>>>>
Image Name   >>>> ubuntu-AMI-NV
Image Description   >>>>  copy AMI from the One region to another region .
Not click on Create Image button.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I got one AMI inside this AWS Account you can check 
 
wait for few min AMI status should pending to Available like that
update AMI name and copy AMI also ..
When its created or Available then Goto Actions  options  >>>  Copy AMI  >>>   open this form
 
Original AMI ID name  >>>   ubuntu-AMI-NV    
Region   >>>>  Us West ( Oregon )
And Goto Click   Copy AMI  button 
How to check AMI is created or not  >>>  open duplicate tab
User logged with AWS account change the region name and check AMI is created or not.
You can check another region you got AMI it is Got Images  >>>  AMI & snapshots Got it in EC2 Dashboard tab both ..
When AMI is created & Avialable  then you can GOTO    Launch instance from AMI  then open one form ...

Open new Page Launch an instance ..
Name & tags  >>>  oregon-ec2
not select and AMI   
AMI from catalog   >>>   already get AMI here.
MY AMIs     >>>   already you are owner for the same AMI
for verify AMI Goto AMI from catalog tab  ...
already created name  >>>  Going down  Select Key pair name in dropdown  if you not have any key so you can create key pair for the region ...
create key pair file 

 
Enter Key Pair  , create .pem file and create key pair button and click and download file ...
select file their and Launch instance its working ....

How to Attach / Mount EBS Volume in Ubuntu and Windows   >>>>>>>>>>>
EBS ( Elastic Block Storage )  >>>
Is a amazon block-level storage service that is intended to be used exclusively with separate EC2 instances ; no two instances can have the same EBS volume attached to them. EBS provides a higher performance option for many use cases  because it is directly attached to the instance and it is used for various databases ( both relational and non relational ) as well as wide range applications such a software testing and devlopment.
Features of EBS   >>>
⦁	Amazon EBS persistent storage  volumes also know as Amazon EBS Volumes.
⦁	Region and Availability zone or multiple Physical location of your resources such as instances and Amazon EBS Volume.
⦁	Using Security groups , you can specify the protocols , ports and source IP ranges that can reach your instance.
⦁	Elastic IP addresses are static IPr4  addresses used for dynamic cloud computing.

EBS concepts  >>>
It is the raw unformatted block-level storage ; it is exposed as raw device to the EC2 instance EBS volumes parsist independently from the life of EC2 instance.
An EBS volume is automatically replicated with in an availability zone.
ThoughPut  >>>  It is sequential transfer rate that an SSD or HDD will maintain continuously..

IOPS  ( Input output per second  )    >>>>
EBS volm Types  >>>  
1) GP2 :  General purpose SSD
2) IO1 :  Provisioned SSD
3) ST1 : Throughpur-optimized  HDD
4) SC1 :  Cold Storage HDD

New feature :  EBS Multi Attach   >>>
we can now enable multi-Attach on Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS  io1 volumes to allow a single volm to be concurrently attached to up to 16 Aws Nitro System based Amazon EC2 instance in the same availability zone.

Volume Types   >>>
GP2 :  General purpose SSD
⦁	Baseline  performance is 3 IOPS/GB with  a min of 100 IOPS and a max of 10000 IOPS.
⦁	Max burst performance is 3000 IOPS.
⦁	Max throughput per volume is 160 MB/S ( 16 KB IO size ).
IO1 :  Provisioned  SSD 
⦁	From 100 to 32000  IOPS can be provisioned.
⦁	Max throughput per volumn is 500 MB/s.
ST1 :  Throughput Optimized HDD  
⦁	Baseline performance is 40 MB/s per TB with  a max of 500 MB/s  per volume.
⦁	Burst performance 250 MB/s TB with a max of 500 MB/s per volume.
SC1 :  cold Storage HDD 
⦁	Baseline performance is 12 MB/s per TB with the max of 192 MB/s per volume.
⦁	Burst performance 80 MB/s TB with a max of 250 MB/s per volume.





First you can create EC2 instance  >>>>
Search EBS in AWS account inside dashboard ...
Goto  Elastic Block Store   menu   >>>  Select Volumes   >>>    create volume 
open one form  

 
Click on Create Volume button its create volume ...
You can check list of volume in AWS account.
